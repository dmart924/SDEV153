                Jake has been an avowed fan of comic books for his entire life. He has spent many years honing his
                skills as an artist, and has many quality works to show for it.

                Dan is a big fan of movies and has a lot of opinions on the movies he has seen. One of his most 
                controversial opinions is that the extended cut of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is inferior to the theatrical release. He also collects too many books.
