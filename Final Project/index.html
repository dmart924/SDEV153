    <h2>Welcome to Mad Rokh</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="resort">Mad Rokh Publications</span> has been writing and self-publishing 
        digital comics since 2019. We do our best to keep the wheels of creation turning, even 
        in our down time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        We are home to Remnants, a digitally based sci-fi epic. Our first priority will remain
        Remnants, until we are far enough off the ground to be able to tackle multiple projects simulataneously. 
        We both work fulltime in addition to work on the comic and other ventures that we need in 
        order to live. It is important to us that we keep pushing, and especially that we retain
        our self-respect while doing so. We highly value our artistic autonomy and don't wish to 
        give that up easily.
    </p>
    <br />
